Description of the C Program: Library Reservation System
A Library Reservation System is an essential tool for managing book reservations in a library. This C program is designed as an Operating Systems (OS) project to simulate the functionalities of a library reservation system. It includes features such as reserving books, checking book availability, and managing user reservations. The program highlights the use of data structures, file handling, and user interaction within an OS context.

Program Overview
The Library Reservation System in C provides an efficient way to handle book reservations for library users. The system maintains records of books and user reservations, ensuring smooth operation and easy management of library resources. It uses file handling for persistent storage and offers a simple command-line interface for user interaction.

Key Components
Data Structures:

Book: A struct representing a book with fields such as book ID, title, author, and availability status.
User: A struct representing a user with fields such as user ID, name, and a list of reserved books.
Reservation: A struct that links users and books, managing the reservation details.
File Handling:

Functions to read from and write to files to store book and user data persistently.
Separate files for storing book information and user reservations.
CRUD Operations:

Create: Add new books to the library collection.
Read: View book details and check availability.
Update: Modify book information and reservation status.
Delete: Remove books from the collection and manage user reservations.
Reservation Management:

Functions to reserve a book, cancel a reservation, and check the reservation status.
Ensure that a book can only be reserved if it is available.
User Interface:

A command-line interface that provides a menu for different operations like adding books, reserving books, viewing reservations, and exiting the system.
User prompts for necessary inputs and displays relevant information based on user actions.
Error Handling:

Robust error handling for scenarios such as invalid inputs, file access issues, and operations on non-existent books or users.
Example Workflow
Initialization:

Load existing book and user data from files into memory.
Initialize data structures to hold the book and reservation information.
Main Menu:

Display a menu with options to add books, view books, reserve books, cancel reservations, and exit the program.
Prompt the user for a choice and perform the corresponding action.
Add Book:

Prompt the user for book details (ID, title, author).
Add the new book to the library collection and save the updated list to the file.
View Books:

Display a list of all books in the library along with their availability status.
Option to search for books by ID or title and display their details.
Reserve Book:

Prompt the user for their ID and the book ID they wish to reserve.
Check the availability of the book and reserve it if available, updating the reservation status and saving the changes.
Cancel Reservation:

Prompt the user for their ID and the book ID they wish to cancel the reservation for.
Update the bookâ€™s availability status and remove the reservation, saving the changes.
Exit:

Save the current state of the book and reservation data to files.
Exit the program gracefully.
Challenges Addressed
Data Persistence:

Ensuring that book and reservation data is saved and can be retrieved across sessions using file handling techniques.
Concurrency (optional):

Implementing locking mechanisms to handle concurrent access to the book and reservation files, if the program is extended to support multiple users.
User Input Validation:

Ensuring that user inputs are validated to prevent errors and inconsistencies in the book and reservation data.
This C program demonstrates essential concepts in file handling, data management, and user interaction. It serves as a practical example for students learning about operating systems and software development, highlighting the importance of efficient resource management and user-friendly interfaces in real-world applications.
